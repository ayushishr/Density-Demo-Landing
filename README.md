  Gatsby Minimal Starter
</h1>



## ðŸš€ Challenges Faced and Solutions:

a. Learning New TechStack Gatsby: The initial challenge was to familiarize oneself with Gatsby through its official documentation. Understanding the framework's file structure and concepts was crucial to proceed.

b. Styled Components Implementation: Integrating styled components for styling posed a challenge, but it was overcome by breaking down the styling into modular components. This approach improved code organization and readability.

c. Component Implementation: Creating individual components such as the navbar, body components, and footer required careful consideration of their functionality. Breaking down the page into smaller, manageable components aided in the development process.

d. Placement and Layout Challenges: Placing elements precisely on the page sometimes presented challenges. However, through experimentation and fine-tuning, the optimal layout was achieved.

e. CSS Knowledge enhanced : The assignment provided an opportunity to reinforce CSS knowledge, especially in terms of modern practices and responsive design.
